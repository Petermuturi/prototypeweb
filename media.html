     <h3><center>Types of Data Transmission Media</center></h3>
      <article>
	 <h4>1: A <span>Twisted pair cable</span> is made up of 2 insulated copper wires twisted around each other in a spiral pattern.  This prevents electromagnetic fields from developing around the two wires as they transmit data.</h4>
     <h4>2: <span>Coaxial cables</span> consist of two conductors which are insulated and shielded to provide high noise immunity & also more resistant to electromagnetic interference.</h4>
	 <h4>3: <span>Fibre optic cables</span> are made of transparent glasses and use light to transmit data signals from one point to another on the network.</h4>
	 <h4>4: In<span>Wireless transmission</span>, no physical connections are used to transmit data from one point to another.  Instead a transmitting antenna & a receiver aerial are used to facilitate the communication</h4>

	 <h3><center>Advantages</center></h3>
	 <article>
	 <h4><span>Twisted pair cable</span>
	 -Has high data transfer rates of up to 100 Mbps
      -It is cheap because; of mass production for telephone use.
     </h4>
      <h4><span>Coaxial cables</span>
	  	 -have a large bandwidth (up to 1 Gbps) compared to twisted pair cables;
	 -can carry voice, data and video signals simultaneously;
	 -are more resistant to radio and electromagnetic interference than twisted pair cables.
     </h4>
     <h4><span>Fibre optic cables</span>
     -It is immune to electromagnetic interference, and eavesdropping.
     -It is fast and supports high bandwidth
     -It has low attenuation; hence, a long distance can be covered
     -It is small & light.
     </h4>
     <h4><span>Wireless transmission</span>
     -wireless networks can span large geographical areas easily
      -Can be used in very remote areas that do not have high cost physical infrastructure like telephone lines
      -Flexible.

      <h3><center>Disadvantages</center></h3>
	 <article>
	 <h4><span>Twisted pair cables</span>
	 -They suffer from high attenuation
     -Affected by electromagnetic fields
     -It has low data transmission rates as compared to other cables
	 </h4>
	  <h4><span>Coaxial cables</span>
	 -They are hard to work with
     -They are expensive to buy & install
	 </h4>
	  <h4><span>Fibre optic cables</span>
	 -Difficult & expensive to install
     -Once broken, it is difficult & expensive to repair.
