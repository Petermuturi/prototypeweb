	 <h1><center>ABOUT ME</center></h1>
	<center><p>I love France. The national flag of France is a tricolour flag featuring three vertical bands coloured blue (hoist side), white, and red.
 Blue and red are the traditional colours of Paris, used on the city's coat of arms. Blue is identified with Saint Martin,red with Saint Denis. At the storming of the Bastille in 1789, the Paris militia wore blue and red cockades on their hats. France has 37 sites inscribed in UNESCO's World Heritage List and features cities of high cultural interest (Paris being the foremost, but also Toulouse, Strasbourg, Bordeaux, Lyon, and others), beaches and seaside resorts, ski resorts, and rural regions that many enjoy for their beauty and tranquillity (green tourism). 
     Small and picturesque French villages of quality heritage(such as Collonges-la-Rouge or Locronan) are promoted through the association <span>Les Plus Beaux Villages de France</span> (litt. "The Most Beautiful Villages of France"). 
Paris, the capital city, is the third most visited city in the world. Paris has some of the world's largest and renowned museums, including the Louvre, which is the most visited art museum in the world, but also the Musée d'Orsay, mostly devoted to impressionism, and Beaubourg, dedicated to Contemporary art. 
Paris hosts some of the world's most recognizable landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower, which is the most-visited paid monument in the world,the Arc de Triomphe, the cathedral of Notre-Dame or the Sacré-Cœur. The Cité des Sciences et de l'Industrie is the biggest science museum in Europe
	With more than 10 million tourists a year, the French Riviera (or <span>Côte d'Azur</span>), in south-eastern France, is the second leading tourist destination in the country, after the Parisian region. According to the Côte d'Azur Economic Development Agency, it benefits from 300 days of sunshine per year, 
 115 kilometres (71 mi) of coastline and beaches, 18 golf courses, 14 ski resorts and 3,000 restaurants.Each year the Côte d'Azur hosts 50% of the world's superyacht fleet, with 90% of all superyachts visiting the region's coast at least once in their lifetime
<span>Les Plus Beaux Villages de France </span>("The most beautiful villages of France") is an independent association, created in 1982, that aims to promote small and picturesque French villages of quality heritage. As of 2008, 152 villages in France have been labelled as the "Plus Beaux Villages de France".
